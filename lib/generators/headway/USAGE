Description:
  Headway Locale generator creates locale files, application configuration, and
  helpers. Locale file location and application configuration support lazy
  lookup.

Example:
    rails generate locale home

    This will create:
      app/helpers/i18n_helper.rb
      config/initializers/i18n.rb
      config/locales/views/home/en.yml
